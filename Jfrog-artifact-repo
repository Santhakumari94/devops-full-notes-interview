Artifactory Repository
Artifactory repositories are used for distributing the artifacts through various stages of develop to delivery in facilitating the ci/cd process

There are many 3rd party vendors providing artifactory softwares, few are commercial and others are opensource like
1. nexus repository (commercial)
2. jfrog platform (commercial)	
	
jfrog platform
JFrog platform is a full suite comes with rich set of features as below.
	1. dependency management through different types of repositories (jar/war/ear)
	2. container registry for distributing container images (docker images)
	3. release management pipelines
	4. security scanner
	5. distribution
	
different organizations requires different tool set based on their application nature and release process, jfrog even offers the above tools individually also

jfrog artifactory (commercial)
used for publishing the application build artifacts (maven, gradle), along with jfrog artifactory they provide community edition of artifactory jfrog artifactory oss where in it supports proxying few central servers (jcentral, maven central, bitnary)	
	
jfrog container registry (opensource)	
- container images of the organization can be distributed locally across


How to work with JFrog Artifactory (OSS)
The JFrog artifact supports 3 types of repositories 
1. Local Repository = publishing the build artifacts of a project locally, so that it can be distributed across the teams or through different stages of ci/cd pipeline

2. Remote Repository = These are used for proxying the central repositories
		- which central repositories should be proxied
		- what stages of artiacts (snapshots, alpha, beta, rc, release)
		- inclusion
		- exclusion
		
3. Virtual Repository = combination of both local and remote repository, so that we we are doing a maven build the virtual repository redirects to remote repostiory for pulling the dependencies/artifacts and when publish the artifacts it talks to local repository.

How to install and use JFrog artifactory oss?
-----------------------------------------------
JFrog artifactory oss repository works only on domain name, it doesnt allows ip:port based urls in serving the artifacts. So to work with jfrog and make it accessible over domain name only we need apache2 server which plays a role of proxy here.

How to install and configure apache2 server?
--------------------------------------------
1. 
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y apache2

2. need to enable http_proxy modules on the apache2 server to work as a proxy redirector
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
sudo a2enmod lbmethod_byrequests

3. create an virtualhost configuration file in which we can configure for a give server address, forward the request to a backend application as a proxy
goto /etc/apache2/sites-available
touch repo.fithealth.conf

repo.fithealth.conf
---------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName www.repo.fithealth.com
	ProxyPreserveHost on
	ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:9099
	ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:9099
</VirtualHost

4. sudo a2ensite repo.fithealth.com
5. sudo systemctl reload apache2
7. sudo systemctl restart apache2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#2 on the host/client computer, map the ip of the apache2 virtual machine with domain name
/etc/hosts
192.168.1.12 rep.fithealth.com
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#3 How to install JFrog artifactory oss repository

1. create an /u01/middleware 
mkdir -p /u01/middleware

2. jfrog artifactory is shipped as binary distribution, now we need to download jfrog binary distribution zip file and extract into /u01/middleware directory above
wget https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/bintray-artifactory/org/artifactory/oss/jfrog-artifactory-oss/[RELEASE]/jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]-linux.tar.gz

3. copy the tar file into /u01/middleware extract it
/u01/middleware$ gunzip jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]-linux.tar.gz
/u01/middleware$ tar -xvf jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]-linux.tar
/u01/middleware$ rm jfrog-artifactory-oss-[RELEASE]-linux.tar

it will extract the artifactory into below directory 
artifactory-oss-7.x

4. change the default port numbers on which artifactory software works
There are 2 parts of artifactory are there
1. ui = a web console through which we can administer artifactory s/w like creating
	- local repositories
	- setting up proxies to remote repository
	- configuring virtual repositories
	
2. endpoints = for distributing depencies through maven build
both of these are running on 2 ports by default 8081/8082 respectively
                                                9090/9099
to change the port on which jfrog is running we need to modify system.yml under directory						artifactory-oss-7.x/var/etc directory. but by default system.yml is not there the jfrog has provided one template file with name system.basic-template.yml

copy the contents of system.basic-template.yml and create system.yml file under $JFROG_HOME/var/etc
artifactory:
  port: 8081
entrypoints:
	externalPort: 8082
	
change both ports to 9091/9099 respectively

3.goto /u01/middleware/artifactory-oss-7.x/app/bin
./artifactoryctl start/stop
