Apache2 Server is an httpd server that allows us to host multiple static websites on a single host computer through virtual host configuration.
  
There are lot of vendors manufacturing and providing httpd servers in the market, few are opensource and few other are commercial. The most popular or well-known httpd servers are 
  1. apache2 httpd server
  2. ngnix

How to host an application and bind it over a dns name to make it accessible?
We can host an application and make it accessible in 2 levels 
1. within intra-network of an organization
2. over the internet making it accessible to the world.
  
#1. Within the intra-network of an organization
To host and make an application accessible within the organization we dont need to have
1. public ip address
2. public domain name
we need to take the local network ip address of the server computer on which httpd server is running and register with a local domainname within the intra-network dns registry or the local system dns registry to make it accessible.
  
Local System dns registry (linux):
goto /etc/hosts and make an entry of domain name with ip address to resolve

/etc/hosts
bakerystore  192.168.1.10

public hosting:
1. purchase an domain name from domain name provider
2. host your apache2 server on public ip address computer.
3. goto dns registry and make an entry of your domain name with public ip address of the machine



How to host a static website using httpd apache2 server?

#1 we need a server machine. 
  if it is a virtual machine, we need to configure networking mode as NAT + Port Forwarding

#2. Install apache2 server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apache2

during the installation of the apache2 it will be registered as systemd service automatically.
The default location the apache2 server will be installed on ubuntu
/etc/apache2
|-sites-available
|-sites-enabled
|-conf

#3. copy the static website root into server machine
The standard directory we place the webroot of the application is /var/www.
/var/www
|-ninestars
|-groovin

both the projects are delivered by developers through git repository, so we need to clone both the repositories. 
    git clone -b master gitRepoUrl
    
#4. change the permission of the website root and child directory files to 755
#5. create virtual host configuration file under /etc/apache2/sites-available to map the domainname of the server to the DocumentRoot directory of the website.
as we have 2 domains name we need to write 2 virtual host configuration files
/etc/apache2/sites-available
|-ninestars.conf
|-groovin.conf

http://ninestars/index.html

ninestars.conf
---------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName ninestar
  DocumentRoot /var/www/ninestars
</VirtualHost>
    
    
groovin.conf
------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName groovin
  DocumentRoot /var/www/groovin
</VirtualHost>

#6. we need to enable both the virtual hosts configurations
sudo a2ensite ninestar
sudo a2ensite groovin

#7 sudo systemctl reload apache2
